# Simple API Framework
This is the beginning of a PHP API Framework I might need for other projects. Don't expect anything spectacular right now; it lacks files and code.

## Focus
* Static and dynamic routing
* Invalid route handler
* Basic DB operations
* Secured with API key
* Callback using anonymous function or class methods

## Note
At the current state of this project, using this in production would be crazy. Just don't do that.
